# odin-recipes

A basic site containing 3 recipes and a home page, made as a part of the odin project. Making this was helpful for getting used to the git workflow although i feel my commit messages can be improved.

This was also an excercise in planning the site structure and finding shortcuts. i found that making the template recipe page first then populating it with the specific content later saved a lot of time and helped keep a consisitant format for each page.
