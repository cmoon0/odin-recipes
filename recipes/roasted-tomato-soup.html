    <h1>Roasted Tomato Soup</h1>
    <img width="500" src="../img/tomato.jpg">

    <p>The simplest soup possible that doesn't come from a tin. If you have extra tomatoes going off in the bottom of the fridge, add them too. You can also roast some bell peppers alongside the tomatoes for a little extra flavour. If you are pressed for time (or energy), roast the onions with the tomatoes instead of cooking them seperately. This makes it a little less flavourful but it is much easier.</p>
    <p>Serves about 4 depending on how much extra liquid is added towards the end. This recipe is designed to be adaptable feel free to improvise with extra herbs and spices (try adding a little paprika or chilli powder when cooking the onions down). </p>
    <p>Dont worry about fully caramalizeing the onions, they only need to be soft. If you want to delve into the world of caramelising onions, try <a href="french-onion-soup.html">this</a> recipe.</p>
