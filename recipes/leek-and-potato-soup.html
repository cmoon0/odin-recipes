    <h1>Leek and Potato Soup</h1>
    <img width="500" alt="Two bowls of creamy leek and potato soup surrounded by ingredients." src="../img/leek-and-potato.jpg">

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is quite filling and fairly cheap to make. Can be made year round but works best when leeks are in season. Dont worry too much about the variety of potatoes used, they get cooked down anyway.</p>
    <p>Serves roughly 4 and freezes well. Serve with lots of pepper, if you want. This recipe is best made with a fair amount of improvisation; if you want to add more herbs, go right ahead!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>500g washed leeks</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive or vegetable oil</li>
        <li>3-5 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>500g small potatos</li>
        <li>dried (or fresh if available) thyme</li>
        <li>500ml vegetable stock</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Thinly slice the leeks and crush ans slice the garlic.</li>
        <li>Add to a large pot with the oil over a low heat, stirring occasionally to prevent burning. Break the leeks up as you stir.</li>
        <li>While the leeks cook, chop all the potatos into even chunks, no larger than an inch cubed.</li>
        <li>Once the leeks are soft, add the potatos, stock and thyme. Bring to a gentle simmer.</li>
        <li>Cook until the potatos are soft enough to mash with a spoon. Take off the heat and remove any fresh thyme added.</li>
        <li><em>Optional:</em> blitz until smooth (to preference) with an immersion blender and serve. Otherwise, serve as is.</li>
    </ol>
