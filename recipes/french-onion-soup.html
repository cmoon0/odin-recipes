    <img width="500" src="../img/french-onion.jpg">

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large onions</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2-4 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>1/2 cup white wine</li>
        <li>1 litre of beef stock</li>
        <li>2 sprigs thyme</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>3 teaspoons worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>grated gruy&egrave;re cheese to cover</li>
        <li>sliced baguette</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Halve and thinly slice the onions.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a large pot over medium heat and add the onions once melted.</li>
        <li>Stir onions until softened and slightly translucent then lower the heat. Continue stirring regularly and caramalize for at least 45 minutes, preferably for 1 to 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Once the onions are a dark brown colour, season with salt and pepper. Pour in the wine and scrape the bottom of the pot to deglaze.</li>
        <li>Mince the garlic and add to the pot along with the stock, thyme, bay leaves and worcestershire sauce.</li>
        <li>Simmer for a further 20 mins over a low to medium heat.</li>
        <li><em>Optional:</em> Portion the soup into oven-save bowls. Add a slice of lightly toasted baguette and cover with cheese. Grill until the cheese is melted and serve. Otherwise serve with baguette and cheese without grilling.</li>

    </ol>
